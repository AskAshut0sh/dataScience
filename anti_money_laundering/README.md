# AML End to End Example

## Project description
This project demonstrates end to end pipeline how to train binary anti money laundering (AML) classifier based on 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Graph embeddings. Proposed solution includes following sub sections:  

* Data load and feature engineering - We will use sample of transactions data generated by [AMLSim](https://github.com/IBM/AMLSim) 
* Feature store â€“ You wull use Hopsworks Feature Store to compute features, organize them as feature groups and store for 
downstream analysis, such as creating feature views and training datasets for model training, as well as retrieving them      
* Anomaly detection model - We will use keras implementation of [adversarial anomaly detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11034.pdf) that was adapted to tabular data.
* Model serving - You will use Hopsworks model server to predict suspicious transactions. 

## Anomaly detection model
